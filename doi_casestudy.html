        <div class="decor"></div>
        <p>For this project a teammate and I were tasked with choosing a U.S. government website that needed redesign
            then completing that redesign. We chose the Department of the Interior (DOI) because their broad mission to
            protect the country's resources and manage relationships with native communities needs buy-in from U.S.
            residents. But, the current website does not serve their mission.
        </p>
        <p>I worked with a partner to conduct research and evaluate areas of improvement on the current DOI website. We
            then worked separately to complete our own redesign of one user path on the site.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
        <h2 class="font2">Research</h2>
        <div class="decor"></div>
        <p>To start this project we got familiar with the DOI website then developed a proto-persona to help us
            hypothesize what a person visiting the doi.gov may need and hope to find.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/protopersona.png" alt="Drawing of a person in a red sweatshirt">
        <p>With that persona in mind we looked at the typical path they might follow and determined what areas we most
            wanted to test with users. Through our initial usability testing we wanted to find out how users were able
            to find information on the site. We asked them to find how to volunteer for the DOI and to sign up for the
            email list.</p>
        <p>
            We also conducted a second set of testing specifically on the overall navigation of the site. These users
            were asked to use the current navigation to find information on the DOI policies on the climate crisis,
            locate the DOI blog, and find the media contact for the department so that we could evaluate the layout of
            the navigation.
        </p>

        <div class="decor"></div>
        <ul>We noted the following:
            <li>Though the DOI clearly values their volunteer involvement as shown in the header on their About page,
                there is a lack of concrete information about actually volunteering on the site.
            </li>
            <li>What volunteer information does exist is presented in a boring and uninspiring manner.
            </li>
            <li>The process to sign up for the DOI email list is overly long and confusing. There are many pages without
                any status of where the user is in the process. Some pages include asking the user to sign up for other
                government email lists that have nothing to do with DOI.
            </li>
            <li>The user is asked to create a password in order to manage their email subscription, but there is no
                place on the website to login to do so.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Assets/DOI_testinganalysis.png" alt="Chart with sticky notes">
        <ul>Concerning navigation:
            <li>The priorities section is aptly named, all users were able to find the sections here easily and quickly.
            </li>
            <li>The DOI blog is interesting and has a lot of good information, however it is not easy for the user to
                find. All users had to look in multiple locations before they found it.
            </li>
            <li>Media contact information for the DOI was difficult to locate. Again, no users were able to find it
                easily.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="ideation">
        <h2 class="font2">Ideation</h2>
        <div class="decor"></div>
        <p>I then worked with my research partner to conduct card sorting on the navigation. We determined that several
            sections of the navigation are misleading or poorly placed. Individually, I created a new sitemap and
            navigation.</p>
        <img src="Assets/DOI_cardsort.png" alt="Sticky notes sorted by type">
        <p>The main navigation is arranged by hierarchy, but each section is then arranged by its own principle. For
            example, the Bureaus & Offices are arranged by alphabet in order to make it easier to scan, while the About
            section is arranged by hierarchy.</p>
        <img src="Assets/sitemap_main.png" alt="Redesigned sitemap of the DOI website">
        <p>User testing on the navigation showed interesting results about the location of the DOI Blog. Half of users
            tested thought the blog belonged in the social media section, while the other half thought it belonged in
            the news section. With split results, I decided to put it in the news section because the articles on the
            blog are updated frequently and most resemble news articles rather than social media posts.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="prototypes">
        <h2 class="font2">Prototypes</h2>
        <div class="decor"></div>
        <h4 class="font2">Lo-Fidelity</h4>
        <p>In addition to the navigation, I chose to focus on the volunteer path for this redesign. The DOI has 280,000
            volunteers and clearly values them. Improving this path is most likely to engage users and get them excited
            about the mission of the DOI.
        </p>
        <p>I created wireframes for the homepage and the volunteer path. I wanted the main focus of the homepage to be a
            hero header with a photo of a beautiful natural scene in the US to reflect the mission of the DOI. I used
            cards to display information and news that is important to the DOI below the fold.
        </p>
        <div class="wireframeImages">
            <img src="Assets/homepage_wireframes.png" alt="Line drawings of the DOI homepage redesign">
            <img src="Assets/nav_wireframe.png" alt="Line drawing of the DOI navigation">
            <img src="Assets/mobile_nav_wireframe.png" alt="Line drawing of the DOI mobile navigation">
        </div>
        <p>Based on feedback, I re-organized the layout of the homepage to have the Explore the DOI section above the
            News in order to more prominently feature those important items. I also included a direct link to the DOI
            blog on the homepage to help users find it quickly. Feedback also showed that the footer looked slightly
            disorganized. I rearranged the spacing to make it more readable.
        </p>
        <p>I initially designed the volunteer page to have a z-layout to draw the userâ€™s eye down the page. However, the
            volunteer page needed more details on the process to actually volunteer with the DOI that best fit in a
            large header. I adjusted the layout and added a simple animation to make the process clear to the user.
        </p>
        <div class="volunteerWireframes">
            <img src="Assets/volunteer_wireframe.png" alt="Line drawings of the initial volunteer page redesign">

            <img src="Assets/volunteer_wireframe_rev.png" alt="Line drawings of the revised volunteer page redesign">
        </div>
        <h4 class="font2">Hi-Fidelity</h4>
        <p>I created a detailed UI style guide for the redesign that included information on colorscheme, typography,
            images, and various elements. I then applied the styles to the homepage wireframe I had developed.</p>
        <p>I conducted a series of 5-second tests on the initial high fidelity mockup of the homepage to get a feel of
            what immediate impression the site left with a user. I asked each user to look at it for 5-10 seconds then
            asked them to tell me how they would describe the site, what they think is the purpose of the site, who it
            is designed for, and their overall impression of the layout.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/DOI_styletile.png" alt="Summary of styles for DOI redesign">
        <p>Overall, the usersâ€™ impression was positive. They noticed and recalled the photo in the hero header most. Two
            testers noted that they appreciated the navbar was prominent at the top. Two also noted that it was well
            organized with everything in its own spot.
        </p>
        <p>After this testing was completed, I proceeded to apply the style to all wireframes and create a complete
            high-fidelity clickable prototype.</p>

    <section class="testing">
        <h2 class="font2">Testing</h2>
        <div class="decor"></div>
        <p>I conducted user testing on the high-fidelity prototype to see how users navigated the redesign and what
            overall impression the design left. I asked the users to find the DOI mission, volunteer information, and
            blog.</p>
        <img src="Assets/testing_1.jpg" alt="Two people talking in front of a laptop">
        <img src="Assets/testing_2.jpg" alt="Two people talking while one holds a mobile phone">
        <p>I tested users on both desktop and mobile. 87% of tasks were completed, with the user expected location of
            the DOI blog still split. Though it sometimes wasnâ€™t in the first location a user checked, all users were
            able to find the blog without frustration, so I did not move the blog in the navigation.</p>
        <p>Based on user comments, I adjusted spacing on the icons in the global header and added titles on the
            volunteer testimonial page to make the page easier to scan.

            <li>A thorough UI style guide makes the design process smoother.</li>
            <li>Animations and transitions make a prototype and website feel more real and interesting.

            <li>Designing an interesting layout on mobile can be a challenge, so it is best to start with that screen
                size, keeping the transition to computer in mind.</li>
            <li>People often donâ€™t scroll through a page to find something, so it is crucial to have a well organized
                navigation.</li>
